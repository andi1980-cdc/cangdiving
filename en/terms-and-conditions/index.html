        <h3>
          5. Registration, conclusion of the contract and duration of the
          contract
        </h3>
        The registration for a course can be made in writing, orally or
        electronically. If a registration is completed for a group, the
        group registrant assumes all contractual obligations. The
        registration includes the acceptance of the terms and conditions by
        the client. These become part of the contract between the CDC and
        the client with the registration. The registration is binding
        regardless of the actual participation. The cancellation of a
        registration is subject to costs. Cancellations of certification
        courses or day trips for any reason will incur a fee of 25% per
        person, less any transaction fees we have paid to the payment
        processors.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cancellations received within 14 days of arrival will incur a
            25% per person fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cancellations received within 7 days of arrival will incur a 50%
            fee per person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cancellations received within 3 days of arrival will incur a
            100% cancellation fee per person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unused functions are not refundable. If they do not appear, the
            entire payment is forfeited...
          </li>
        </ul>
        The contract begins at the specifically or individually agreed time.
        The duration of the contract for the courses depends on the
        specified teaching units and practical exercises of the training
        regulations or on the individually agreed duration.

        <h4>5.1 Non-Agency Disclosure and Acknowledgment Agreement</h4>
        I understand and agree that PADI Members (“Members”), including
        Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. and/or any individual PADI | TDI/SDI
        Instructors and Divemasters associated with the program in which I
        am participating, are licensed to use various PADI | TDI/SDI
        Trademarks and to conduct PADI | TDI/SDI training, but are not
        agents, employees or franchisees of:
        <ul>
          <li>
            PADI Americas, Inc, or its parent, subsidiary and affiliated
            corporations (“PADI”).
          </li>
          <li>
            TDI/SDI, or its parent, subsidiary and affiliated corporations
            ("TDI/SDI").
          </li>
        </ul>
        I further understand that Member business activities are
        independent, and are neither owned nor operated by PADI | TDI/SDI,
        and that while PADI | TDI/SDI establishes the standards for PADI |
        TDI/SDI diver training programs, it is not responsible for, nor does
        it have the right to control, the operation of the Members' business
        activities and the day-to-day conduct of PADI | TDI/SDI programs and
        supervision of divers by the Members or their associated staff. I
        further understand and agree that Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. is
        not responsible in any PADI | TDI/SDI branded Materials neither for
        the Content, function or correctness.
        <h4>5.2 Liability Release and Assumption of Risk Agreement</h4>
        I, (client), hereby affirm that I am a certified scuba diver or a
        student diver under the control and supervision of a certified scuba
        instructor, and that I thoroughly understand the hazards of scuba
        diving including those hazards occurring during boat travel to and
        from the dive site (hereinafter collectively referred to as
        "Excursion"). I understand that these inherent risks include, but
        are not limited to, drowning, air expansion injuries, decompression
        sickness, embolism, or other hyperbaric injuries that require
        treatment in a recompression chamber; slipping or falling while on
        board, being cut or struck by a boat while in the water, injuries
        occurring while getting on or off a boat, and other perils of the
        sea; all of which can result in serious injury or death. I
        understand the Excursion will be conducted at a site that is remote,
        either by time or distance or both, from a recompression chamber and
        emergency medical facilities. I still choose to proceed with the
        Excursion. By signing this Agreement, I certify that I am fully
        aware of and expressly assume these and all other risks involved in
        making such a boat trip and scuba dive(s), whether conducted as a
        certified diver or a student diver in a diving class. I understand
        and agree that neither Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. the dive
        professional(s); nor the crew or owner of the vessel; nor the vessel
        itself; nor PADI | TDI |SDI, nor its affiliate or subsidiary
        corporations; nor the owners, officers, employees, agents,
        contractors or assigns of the above listed individuals and/or
        entities (hereinafter "Released Parties") may be held liable or
        responsible in any way for any personal injury, property damage,
        wrongful death or other damages to me or my family, estate, heirs or
        assigns that may occur as a result of my participation in this
        Excursion, or as a result of the negligence of any party, including
        the Released Parties, whether passive or active. I affirm I am in
        good mental and physical fitness to scuba dive. I further state that
        I am not under the influence of alcohol or any drugs that are
        contradicted to diving. If I am taking medication, I affirm that I
        have seen a physician and have approval to dive while under the
        influence of the medication/drugs. I understand that skin and scuba
        diving are physically strenuous activities and that I will be
        exerting myself during this Excursion, and that if I am injured as a
        result of heart attack, panic, hyperventilation, drowning or any
        other cause, that I expressly assume the risk of said injuries and
        that I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for the same.
        I am aware that safe dive practices suggest diving with a buddy
        unless trained as a self-reliant diver. Accordingly, it is my
        responsibility to plan my dive allowing for my diving experience and
        limitations, and the prevailing water conditions and environment. I
        will not hold the Released Parties responsible for my failure to
        safely plan my dive, dive my plan, and follow the instructions and
        dive briefing of the dive professional(s)/vessel crew. I affirm it
        is my responsibility to inspect all of my equipment prior to the
        Excursion and that I should not dive if my equipment is not
        functioning properly. I will not hold the Released Parties
        responsible for my failure to inspect my equipment prior to diving
        or if I choose to dive with equipment that may not be functioning
        properly. I further state that I am of lawful age and legally
        competent to sign this Agreement, or that I have obtained the
        written consent of my parent or guardian. I understand the terms
        herein are contractual and not a mere recital, and that I have
        signed this Agreement of my own free act and with the knowledge that
        I hereby agree to waive my legal rights. I further agree that if any
        provision of this Agreement if found to be unenforceable or invalid,
        that provision shall be severed from this Agreement. The remainder
        of this Agreement will then be construed as though the unenforceable
        provision had never been contained herein. I understand and agree
        that I am not only giving up my right to sue the Released Parties
        but also any rights my heirs, assigns or beneficiaries may have to
        sue the Released Parties resulting from my death. I further
        represent that I have the authority to do so and my heirs, assigns
        and beneficiaries will be estopped from claiming otherwise because
        of my representations to the Released Parties. I, (client), BY THIS
        INSTRUMENT, AGREE TO EXEMPT AND RELEASE ALL THE ABOVE LISTED
        ENTITIES AND/OR INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
        FOR PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR WRONGFUL DEATH, HOWEVER
        CAUSED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR THE
        NEGLIGENCE OF THE RELEASED PARTIES, WHETHER PASSIVE OR ACTIVE. I
        HAVE FULLY INFORMED MYSELF AND MY HEIRS OF THE CONTENTS OF THIS
        NON-AGENCY DISCLOSURE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT AGREEMENT AND LIABILITY
        RELEASE AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK AGREEMENT BY READING BOTH BEFORE I
        SIGNED BELOW ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY HEIRS.

        <h3>6. Prices and payment methods</h3>
        The course prices are based on the CDC prices valid at the time of
        the conclusion of the contract. The price list is published on the
        internet site. All stated prices include the value-added tax valid
        at the time of service provision. The client will receive an invoice
        with his registration. This is to be paid at the latest before the
        course begins by cash payment or by bank transfer (credit card).
        Decisive for the settlement of the course price is the amount
        received by CDC, not the amount instructed.

        <h3>7. scope of services and unused services</h3>
        The scope of services depends on the respective contract between CDC
        and the client. If individual services are not used by the client,
        the CDC reserves the right to retain the entire course price. If the
        course is interrupted for health reasons (proof by means of a
        certificate), there will be no refund of services already used. The
        CDC is responsible for determining the amount to be refunded for
        course services not yet used. If it is possible to continue the
        course within 12 months after termination, there will be no new
        costs. However, the student must be fit to dive again. If more than
        12 months elapse, the client must register for a new course. The
        costs for this are borne by the client. The following cancellation
        conditions apply to all courses and day trips: Cancellations of
        certification courses or day trips for any reason will incur a 25%
        per person fee, less any transaction fees we have paid to the
        payment processors.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cancellations received within 14 days of arrival will incur a
            25% per person fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cancellations received within 7 days of arrival will incur a 50%
            fee per person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cancellations received within 3 days of arrival will incur a
            100% cancellation fee per person.
          </li>
        </ul>
        In case of illness, 75% of the course price will also be refunded up
        to 8 hours before the agreed appointment, only upon presentation of
        a medical certificate. If the client has registered for external
        services within the scope of an event, which are only mediated by
        CDC, a possible reimbursement is based on the conditions of the
        provider of the external service plus the above mentioned 25%.

        <h3>8. Conditions of participation</h3>
        The prerequisites, the required training level, the number of
        mandatory dives (diving experience) for the courses can be found in
        the respective description and in the SUB training regulations from
        the Internet site.    The diving instructor or dive guide is
        authorized to give instructions to the client for the duration of
        the course. The client is obliged to follow the instructions. The
        client is in breach of contract if despite a warning, he/she
        persistently disrupts the course, or if a smooth running of the
        course cannot be guaranteed due to his/her behaviour. Furthermore,
        the CDC is entitled to terminate the course immediately in case of
        safety concerns of any kind (above and underwater). In all cases,
        the CDC reserves the right to exclude the client from the course. In
        case of a cancellation or exclusion, the client has no right to a
        refund of the course price. The same applies to expenses incurred by
        the client. If the client is absent on one or more agreed dates,
        resulting in additional dates will be charged by the CDC to the
        client as follows per theory unit 1000 ThB and per practice unit
        3490 ThB. The CDC is not liable for theft, damage or loss of
        personal belongings, valuables or the diving equipment used. For the
        introductory and beginner training (OWD) the necessary equipment is
        provided. This must be handled with care. The student is liable for
        any damage or loss caused by him/her. For further diving courses a
        complete, functional, tested and maintained cold water suitable
        diving equipment is required or can be borrowed from the CDC for an
        extra charge. The "safety standards for diving" must be followed by
        the client during courses.

        <h3>
          9. Before dives / diving tours / diving day trips / snorkeling /
          boat trips with us,
        </h3>
        you will be asked to complete and sign a disclaimer and a statement
        of health. For diving courses/training, you must complete an
        acceptance of risk and a statement of health from the relevant
        diving organisation before the start of the course (this is not
        necessary if you present us with a medical certificate from your
        doctor stating that you are fully fit to dive). For students over 45
        years of age, we ask for a medical certificate, not older than 2
        years if you cannot answer NO to the declaration of health. Underage
        students must present a diving examination according to GTUEM
        guidelines. Irrespective of the valid diving fitness certificate, a
        current good state of health as well as physical and mental
        well-being are prerequisites for participation in a dive. This
        includes a healthy diet, a balanced fluid balance and the
        renunciation of drugs, nicotine, alcohol and other intoxicating
        substances. In case of misuse this will inevitably lead to exclusion
        from the course. Any costs resulting from this shall be borne by the
        client. In case of doubts about the health or psychological
        suitability, the CDC is entitled to exclude the client concerned
        from all courses. The participation in the courses offered by the
        CDC is always at the client's own risk. Overall, diving is a safe
        sport. However, there is always a residual risk. The CDC therefore
        expressly recommends that you take out diving accident insurance
        (e.g. with DAN). The training is only completed and the brevet is
        only handed over to the participant when he/she has mastered all the
        theoretical and practical evidence listed in the training record.
        The corresponding assessment is made exclusively by the instructor.
        The mere participation in a course and its payment does not entitle
        the participant to receive a corresponding certification.

        <h3>10. data use and data protection</h3>
        The collection, processing and storage of personal data is carried
        out in accordance with the legal data protection regulations. The
        client agrees that his data may be processed, stored and used by CDC
        for the purpose of proof of education, contract handling and for the
        maintenance of the business relationship. In particular, the data
        will be treated confidentially and will not be passed on to third
        parties.

        <h3>11. liability</h3>
        The CDC is liable in cases of intent or gross negligence according
        to the legal regulations. The liability for guarantees is
        independent of fault. In cases of slight negligence, the CDC is only
        liable according to the regulations of the product liability law,
        because of injury of life, body or health or because of violation of
        essential contractual obligations. The claim for damages for the
        slightly negligent violation of essential contractual obligations
        is, however, limited to the contract-typical, foreseeable damage,
        unless liability is assumed due to injury to life, body or health.
        The CDC is liable for the fault of vicarious agents and
        representatives to the same extent. This regulation extends to
        compensation in addition to performance, compensation instead of
        performance and the claim for compensation because of futile
        expenses, no matter for which legal reason, including the liability
        because of defects, delay or impossibility.

        <h3>12. Place of jurisdiction</h3>
        The entire legal relationship between the parties is subject to Thai
        law, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International
        Sale of Goods (CISG).

        <h3>13. Other provisions</h3>
        There are no subsidiary agreements to this contract. Changes or
        additions must be made in writing to be legally effective. Should
        individual passages become invalid due to other legal norms, the
        remaining parts of the AGB remain legally effective.

        <h3>14. price changes</h3>
        We reserve the right to make price changes at any time, the already
        booked services & prices from you, but will be retained.

        <h3>15. safety at the dive site and during diving</h3>
        We also reserve the right to make short-term changes (such as dive
        site selection - dive depth etc.) for the planned dive site. Our
        dive guides are experienced and professional Divemasters &
        Instructors with many years of experience at the dive sites around
        Koh Chang.

        course, the deposit will be retained.
