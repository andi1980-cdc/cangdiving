        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

        <h3>1. Scope</h3>
        <p>
          The following general terms and conditions apply to all legal
          transactions involving the provision of logistical services and
          facilities by Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. (hereinafter referred to
          as "CDC"). These include, but are not limited to, the rental or use of
          premises, boats, equipment, vehicles, and associated services for
          recreational scuba diving activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          CDC does not offer scuba diving instruction or certifications itself.
          All educational services, including courses and training, are
          independently provided by certified instructors affiliated with
          recognized training agencies. CDCâ€™s general terms and conditions apply
          to all transactions, whether concluded in person, by telephone, or
          electronically.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Content of the Online Offer</h3>
        <p>
          Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. (hereinafter referred to as "CDC")
          provides logistical and operational support for recreational diving
          activities. This includes the use of facilities, classrooms, boats,
          vehicles, rental equipment, and other infrastructure necessary to
          conduct diving-related programs and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          CDC does not conduct scuba diving instruction or offer certifications
          itself. All dive courses, training programs, and educational services
          are independently provided by scuba diving instructors who are
          individually certified by recognized training agencies (e.g., PADI,
          SDI, TDI). These instructors operate in their own legal capacity and
          are solely responsible for the content and conduct of such training.
        </p>
        <p>
          A detailed and current listing of available services and activities is
          published on CDCâ€™s website and in other official media. While CDC
          strives to maintain up-to-date and accurate information, no guarantee
          is given regarding the completeness, correctness, or quality of the
          information provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liability claims against CDC related to material or immaterial damages
          resulting from the use or non-use of the information
          presentedâ€”particularly in cases of incorrect or incomplete
          informationâ€”are excluded unless proven to result from intentional
          misconduct or gross negligence by CDC.
        </p>
        <p>
          All published offers are non-binding and subject to change without
          notice. CDC reserves the right to modify, expand, or delete parts of
          its website content or service descriptions at any time without prior
          announcement.
        </p>

        <h3>3. References and Links</h3>
        <p>
          CDC is not responsible for any external content linked or referred to
          from its website, unless CDC had prior knowledge of illegal content
          and had the technical ability and reasonable means to prevent access
          to such content at the time the link was created.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of linking, CDC reviewed the target pages and found no
          evidence of unlawful content. However, CDC has no influence over the
          current or future design, content, or authorship of linked pages.
          Therefore, CDC hereby expressly disassociates itself from all content
          of any linked or referenced pages that may have been changed after the
          link was created.
        </p>
        <p>
          This statement applies to all links and references placed within CDCâ€™s
          own website, as well as to external entries in guestbooks, discussion
          forums, link directories, mailing lists, or any other form of database
          that permits external input.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sole liability for illegal, incorrect, or incomplete contentâ€”and
          in particular for any damages resulting from the use or non-use of
          such informationâ€”lies with the provider of the respective page, not
          with the entity merely referring to the publication via a link.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Copyright and Trademark Law</h3>
        <p>
          CDC endeavors to respect and observe the copyright of all graphics,
          audio materials, video sequences, and texts used in its publications.
          Wherever possible, CDC uses materials it has created itself or content
          that is license-free or otherwise lawfully usable.
        </p>
        <p>
          All brand names and registered trademarks mentioned on this
          websiteâ€”especially those referring to scuba training organizations
          such as PADIÂ®, SDIÂ®, or TDIÂ®â€”are the property of their respective
          trademark holders and are used for descriptive purposes only. The use
          of such names does not imply any official affiliation, agency
          relationship, or endorsement by the respective organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The copyright for any materials created by CDC itself remains
          exclusively with the author. Any reproduction or use of such materials
          (including graphics, sound, video, or text) in other electronic or
          printed media is not permitted without prior written permission from
          CDC.
        </p>

        <h3>
          5. Registration, Conclusion of the Contract and Duration of the
          Contract
        </h3>
        <p>
          Registrations for diving-related services, including training
          activities, may be submitted to Chang Diving Center CO., LTD.
          (hereinafter "CDC") in writing, orally, or electronically. If a
          registration is made for a group, the registering person assumes
          contractual responsibility for all participants listed.
        </p>
        <p>
          By registering, the client agrees to CDCâ€™s general terms and
          conditions. The resulting agreement pertains to the organizational
          coordination, logistical arrangement, and booking services provided by
          CDC, including the assignment of a certified instructor for the
          execution of the requested training activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          While CDC handles scheduling, resource provision, and communication,
          the actual instruction and certification are conducted by
          independently certified scuba instructors. These instructors act in
          their own professional capacity and are solely responsible for the
          conduct, content, and evaluation of the respective training program in
          accordance with the standards of their affiliated training agency
          (e.g., PADI, SDI, TDI).
        </p>
        <p>
          The registration is binding, regardless of actual participation.
          Cancellation of a confirmed booking is subject to the following fees,
          exclusive of any non-refundable transaction costs already incurred by
          CDC:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cancellations received more than 14 days before arrival: 25% fee per
            person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cancellations received within 7 days of arrival: 50% fee per person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cancellations received within 3 days of arrival: 100% fee per
            person.
          </li>
          <li>No-shows or unused services are non-refundable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The agreement enters into force at the individually agreed date. Its
          duration is determined by the booked service scope and the timeline
          required for the scheduled activities or training sessions.
        </p>

        <h3>5.1 Non-Agency and Training Responsibility Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. (CDC) is not a member, affiliate,
          franchisee, or agent of any scuba diving certification agency,
          including but not limited to PADIÂ®, SDIÂ®, or TDIÂ®. CDC does not
          conduct diving instruction, issue certifications, or represent any
          training organization in an official capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          All scuba diving instruction, training programs, and certifications
          booked through CDC are conducted independently by freelance or
          contracted instructors. These instructors are personally certified and
          authorized by their respective training agencies to conduct training
          activities in accordance with the applicable agency standards. CDC
          assigns such instructors to clients based on availability and course
          requirements but is not responsible for the content, outcome, or
          certification process of any training conducted.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the training agencies (e.g., PADIÂ®, TDIÂ®, SDIÂ®) license their
          trademarks and establish diver training standards, they do not control
          or operate the individual business activities of the instructors or of
          CDC. These agencies are not liable for any acts or omissions during
          the training, nor for any contractual arrangements between CDC, the
          instructor, and the client.
        </p>
        <p>
          All agency brand names or references on CDCâ€™s website are used solely
          to describe the instructorâ€™s affiliations and course structure and do
          not imply that CDC itself is a member or training facility of any
          certifying agency.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Prices and Payment Methods</h3>
        <p>
          All prices for services provided by Chang Diving Center CO., LTD.
          (CDC) are based on the official price list valid at the time of
          contract conclusion. The current price list is published on CDCâ€™s
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stated prices include applicable value-added tax (VAT) at the time the
          service is rendered. The client will receive a formal invoice upon
          registration. This invoice must be paid in fullâ€”by cash, credit card,
          or bank transferâ€”prior to the start of the booked activity or
          course-related service.
        </p>
        <p>
          The agreed payment covers CDCâ€™s logistical and organizational
          services, such as coordination, use of equipment, facilities, and
          transportation. Instructional services rendered by independently
          certified scuba instructors are included in the overall package for
          practical reasons, but are provided under the full responsibility of
          the respective instructor. CDC acts solely as the booking and
          coordination party.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decisive payment value is the amount actually received by CDC, not
          the amount instructed for transfer.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Scope of Services and Unused Services</h3>
        <p>
          The scope of services is based on the individual agreement between the
          client and Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. (CDC). This includes
          logistical support, transportation, rental equipment, and coordination
          of certified instructor-led training sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If individual services are not used by the client after booking, CDC
          reserves the right to retain the full service price. No refunds will
          be provided for services already rendered. In the event of illness or
          health-related interruption of training, CDC may grant a partial
          refund for unused servicesâ€”provided a valid medical certificate is
          submitted no later than 8 hours before the scheduled activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a course is interrupted for medical reasons, the client may resume
          within 12 months without additional cost, provided they are medically
          cleared to dive again. After 12 months, a new registration and full
          payment will be required.
        </p>
        <p>
          For services organized by CDC that involve third-party providers
          (e.g., travel arrangements, boat charters, accommodation), any
          reimbursement will be subject to the cancellation terms of the
          respective external provider. CDC will deduct a 25% handling fee in
          such cases.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Conditions of Participation</h3>
        <p>
          Participation in any diving activity requires meeting the relevant
          prerequisites, such as medical fitness, training level, and the number
          of qualifying dives. These requirements are specified in the
          respective course descriptions and according to the training standards
          published by the certifying agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          During training or guided dives, the assigned instructor or dive guide
          has the authority to issue binding instructions to the participant.
          Failure to follow these instructions may lead to exclusion from the
          activity for safety reasons. In cases of serious or repeated
          misconduct, the instructor may terminate the participantâ€™s involvement
          immediately. CDC supports this decision in its role as logistical
          coordinator.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such cases, or if a participant voluntarily cancels or fails to
          attend scheduled sessions, there is no entitlement to a refund of
          services already provided. Missed training sessions may incur
          additional fees for rescheduling or instructor reallocation.
          Applicable charges for theory or practical sessions are listed in the
          current CDC price list available on the official website or upon
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          CDC assumes no liability for loss, theft, or damage of personal
          belongings, including diving equipment. For introductory and beginner
          programs (e.g., Open Water Diver), the required equipment will be
          provided by CDC and must be handled with care. Participants are liable
          for any damage or loss caused through negligence or misuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          For advanced training, participants must provide a complete, tested,
          and well-maintained set of diving equipment suitable for local
          conditions, or may rent suitable equipment from CDC for an additional
          fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          All participants are expected to comply with established diving safety
          standards throughout their involvement in the program.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Before Dives, Dive Tours, Snorkeling or Boat Trips</h3>
        <p>
          Before participating in any diving activity, snorkeling, boat trip, or
          training session coordinated by Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. (CDC),
          each participant is required to complete and sign a liability
          disclaimer and a medical self-assessment form. For dive courses, a
          health declaration and assumption of risk form provided by the
          respective certifying agency must be completed prior to the first
          training session.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, participants may submit a valid medical certificate
          confirming their fitness to dive, issued by a qualified physician. For
          students aged 45 or older who cannot answer "NO" to any question on
          the health declaration, a medical certificate not older than two years
          is mandatory. Underage participants must present a diving medical
          examination that complies with GTUEM or equivalent standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to formal documentation, participants must be in good
          physical and mental health on the day of the activity. This includes
          being well-rested, well-nourished, and free of any influence from
          alcohol, drugs, nicotine, or intoxicants. Any violation of these
          conditions may result in immediate exclusion from the activity. All
          resulting costs shall be borne by the participant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instructors and staff assigned by CDC have the authority to exclude
          participants from any activity if health concerns, safety risks, or
          psychological impairments are suspected. Participation is always at
          the clientâ€™s own risk. While recreational diving is generally safe, it
          carries residual risks. CDC therefore strongly recommends obtaining
          dedicated dive accident insurance (e.g., through DAN or a comparable
          provider).
        </p>
        <p>
          Successful completion of a course requires that all theoretical and
          practical performance requirements, as defined in the relevant
          agencyâ€™s training standards, are fully met. The decision regarding
          certification lies exclusively with the assigned instructor. Mere
          participation and payment do not automatically entitle the participant
          to receive a certification.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Data Use and Data Protection</h3>
        <p>
          The collection, processing, and storage of personal data by Chang
          Diving Center CO., LTD. (CDC) is carried out in accordance with
          applicable data protection laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          By registering for services, the client consents to the use of their
          personal data for the following purposes: handling bookings,
          processing payments, maintaining business communication, and
          documenting participation in diving-related activities. This includes,
          where applicable, storing records for training verification or
          regulatory compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal data will be treated confidentially and will not be disclosed
          to third parties unless required by law or expressly authorized by the
          client. CDC implements appropriate technical and organizational
          measures to protect stored data against unauthorized access, loss, or
          misuse.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Liability</h3>
        <p>
          Chang Diving Center CO., LTD. (CDC) is liable for damages only in
          cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, in accordance
          with applicable legal regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of slight negligence, CDC shall only be liable for
          damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health, or for the
          breach of essential contractual obligations. In such cases, liability
          is limited to typical and foreseeable damage related to the nature of
          the contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          CDC is not liable for training content, conduct of instruction, or
          decisions made by independently operating scuba diving instructors.
          These instructors provide their services in their own professional
          capacity under the standards of their respective training agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          CDC is responsible for its own logistical services and the conduct of
          its employees or legal agents to the extent permitted by law. This
          includes claims for performance, substitute performance, or
          compensation for useless expensesâ€”regardless of the legal basis,
          including liability due to delay, defect, or impossibility.
        </p>

        <h3>12. Place of Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>
          The entire legal relationship between the contracting parties is
          governed by the laws of the Kingdom of Thailand. The application of
          the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
          of Goods (CISG) is excluded.
        </p>

        <h3>13. Other Provisions</h3>
        <p>
          There are no verbal or subsidiary agreements outside of this contract.
          Any changes or additions must be made in writing to be legally valid.
          If individual provisions of these terms and conditions become invalid
          due to legal regulations, all remaining provisions shall remain
          unaffected and in full legal effect.
        </p>

        <h3>14. Price Changes</h3>
        <p>
          CDC reserves the right to change its prices at any time. However,
          services already booked and confirmed at a specific price will remain
          valid at the originally agreed rate.
        </p>

        <h3>15. Safety at the Dive Site and During Diving Activities</h3>
        <p>
          CDC reserves the right to make short-term adjustments to planned dive
          sites or dive parameters (e.g., depth, location) due to weather
          conditions, currents, visibility, or other safety considerations. All
          diving activities are led by qualified and experienced Divemasters and
          Instructors who are familiar with the local dive sites around Koh
          Chang.
        </p>

        <h3>16. Headquarters of the Company</h3>
        <p>
          Chang Diving Center CO., LTD.<br />
          21/52 Moo 4, Klong Prao Beach<br />
          Koh Chang, Trat 23170, Thailand
        </p>

        <h3>17. Down Payment and Non-Refundable Materials</h3>
        <p>
          Deposited funds will be refunded in case of cancellation at least 14
          days before the scheduled course start, minus any non-recoverable
          transaction or processing fees (e.g., PayPal). For cancellations made
          less than 14 days before the start date, the deposit will be retained
          in full.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a diving course includes digital or physical educational materials
          (e.g., eLearning access, digital manuals, certification fees), these
          will be registered to the participant immediately upon payment. Such
          materials are non-transferable and cannot be refunded once access has
          been granted or registration completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such cases, the corresponding portion of the payment covering the
          educational materials is considered consumed and remains
          non-refundable, even if the participant cancels or does not attend the
          course.
        </p>

        <h3>18. Language Version and Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms & Conditions are published in English and may be available
          in translated versions (e.g., German and Thai) for convenience. In the
          event of any inconsistencies or discrepancies between the translated
          versions and the English original, the English version shall prevail.
